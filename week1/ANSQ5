A branch in git is a tool for contributors of a project to create a divergent path of commits.
A branch is different of the default MASTER branch. Basically a branch is a savepoint to use a gaming analogy.
From this "savepoint" a contributor can make a commit in the same way as via the MASTER branch.
However if something ends up malfuncitoning in the the final product you can revert to previous versions. 
It is an effective tool to make changes yourself and not corrupt the project for the rest of a group.
